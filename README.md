# Maiden Flight

My first Flutter application that generates word pairs. This repo is based off the following tutorials:

- [Part 1](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/first-flutter-app-pt1/)
- [Part 2](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/first-flutter-app-pt2/)

## Additions to the Base Tutorial

1. Changed app name to WordPairer
2. Replaced default app icon

3. Set color theme to teal
4. Changed heart color ‚ù§Ô∏è to yellow üíõÔ∏è
5. Display date and time on saved item in list view using the [intl library](https://pub.dev/packages/intl#-installing-tab-)
6. Added a leading icon to saved item in list view using [CupertinoIcons](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/cupertino/CupertinoIcons-class.html)
